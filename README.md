# The Accounting Rubric Reader

The Accounting Rubric Reader is a system designed to read accounting rubrics generated in a standardized TXT format, as outlined by the MANAD (Normative Manual for Digital Files), which is specific to Brazilian accounting practices. The primary goal of this system is to convert the content of these TXT files into a table or PDF format, customized according to the clientâ€™s specifications. This ensures that accounting data is presented in a clear and organized manner, facilitating easier analysis and reporting.
